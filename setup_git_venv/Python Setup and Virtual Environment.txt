1. 	when installing python, click on "add as a path"
2. 	when creating a project, better set up a venv and install packages on virtual environment.

How do we set up a virtual environment? (In the main repo)
1.	Go into the terminal under current folder 
2.	python -m venv .venv (.venv is the virtual environment's name)
3. 	change the interpreter into .venv interpreter
4. 	in the .venv terminal, install packages using 						pip install *PackageName
5.	After project completed, generate the complete package list using 		pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
6. 	For Git control, better have a file in the main repo named ".gitignore" which consists of (at least)
	.venv
	.vscode
7.	To download all the packages in requirements.txt file, use				pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
